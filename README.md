Free Meals

## History

During the 2020-2021 school year, due to the shutdown of in-person activities, school cafeterias were used as meal distribution hubs. There was a grassroots, community-driven effort to arrange pickup and drop off of meals for families in need. Most of my efforts involved sharing the food availability as well as my ability to shuttle the food. I had the pleasure of picking up and delivering as many as 35 meal packages to neighbors in my community three times a week. Food insecurity became a very real issue in my mind, and seeing that there was no singular source for where free or cheap food could be found initiated a desire to provide a solution.

## Problem

There is free food available to those in need, but it can be quite a daunting task to find where it is available let alone work out the scheduling required in order to receive it (example below). 

I have seen cars lined up as early as 6:30am at one location that has a sign that reads 

  "FOOD BANK 3RD THURS & 4TH TUES<br>930 TIL FOOD IS OUT"

This is a simple, but descriptive, example of the huge burden for the food insecure to navigate the scheduling, location, and scarcity of free food resources. 

## Proposed Solution

A “social” application to facilitate the successful grassroots organizing

### Identities: 
  
  * Receiver (people, but also drop-off locations)
  * Deliverer
  * Provider

### Data: 
  * Users
  * Locations
  * Schedules (mostly for matching availability)
  * Foods (nutrition info)

## Why Solid?

It seemed like being able to link the various data points and identities that would control them made Solid a viable part of the solution.
Realistically, though, at the moment Solid is my hammer, and everything looks like a nail.

The application should be able to traverse the linked data and provide matching and scheduling to meet the community needs.

## Personas

  * As a person in need of food, I could sign in, add details about when I was available to receive deliveries and where (or note that I’d like a community drop-off location or pick one).
  * As a person who wanted to serve the community by spending time picking up AND/OR delivering I could put in my availability to do so and a rough driving range I am willing to deliver to.
  * As a provider of free food, I can share information about locations, schedules, and nutrition information for people to match.

## Challenges/Unknowns 

I'm still unclear on the application side of how an individual’s Solid Pod can be leveraged when the application needs to “know” essentially all the data. Most Solid app examples are very individualistic
